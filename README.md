# DEPRECATED Eclipse Paho Client for VAST Platform (VA Smalltalk)

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)



## About

This is an abandoned and unsupported implementation of an MQTT Client v3 for old versions of VAST Platform.

[VAST Platform v12.0](https://www.instantiations.com/vast-platform/version-history/) ships with a new enterprise-grade and extensible MQTT client, written in pure Smalltalk, with support for version 3, 3.11, and 5 protocols. All protocol details are handled internally by the software and run over traditional TLS or non-TLS native sockets. Even VAST's new asynchronous streams are already integrated for easy consumption of publish/subscription updates.
